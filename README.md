# OpenJsComputers
Adds a JavaScript(v8) architecture to OpenComputers.
## Discontinued
Writing this I ran into the problem that you cannot serialize/store the execution state of v8. That means that all computers would be reset after every restart of the game making it hard to use them for automation or continuus jobs which would make it hard to actually find any sensible use for them.
However, I will leave this online and if you happen to be a developer who can work around this then feel free to fork and improve/alter/whatever as described below.
